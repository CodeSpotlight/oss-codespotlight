    <h2>Why CodeSpotlight?</h2>
    <p>
      CodeSpotlight is unique because it bridges the gap between open-source contributions and formal internships. Open source is typically unpaid, but incredibly valuable for real-world experience. This program formalizes that process, offering structure and credibility while empowering you to collaborate, create, and learn in a community-driven environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contributions of any kind are welcome, even if you’re not officially an intern. At CodeSpotlight, your coding journey matters, whether you fix a bug, contribute documentation, or tackle a key feature as part of the program.
